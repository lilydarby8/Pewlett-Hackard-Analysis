# Employee Database Analysis 


## Purpose and Overview of the Employee Database Analysis
   The purpose of the Employee Database Analysis is to prepare the company, Pewlett Hackard, in the wake of many of their employees departing due to their retirement eligibility. The company is calling it the “Silver Tsunami”. The company needs to be prepared and make plans to fulfill the roles that will be open.  
   

## Employee Database Results
- The “unique titles” table shows that there are 90,398
employees who are eligible for retirement. It includes each employees’ full name, employee number, and title.

- The “retiring titles” table is helpful because it groups together all the employees who will be retiring and their titles. Each title has a number preceding it to show how many employees from each title will be retiring.

- The mentorship eligibility table holds the employees born in 1965 who are equipped to be trained by their senior co-workers to fill the soon to be empty roles from those retiring. There are 1,549 employees who qualify for the mentorship program.
- The retiring titles and mentor-eligible titles tables are strikingly different in values. There are not enough eligible employees to fulfill the roles of those retiring.

## Employee Database Analysis 
  There are 90,398 employees retiring, but after factoring in the employees who are mentor-eligible the company will need to hire 88,849 people to fulfill the roles that will need to be filled as those employees retire. Pewlett Hackard will need to hire new employees for each of the following roles in the wake of the Silver Tsunami,
28,885 Senior Engineers
27,686 Senior Staff
14,032 Engineers
12,087 Staff
4,425 Technique Leaders
1,732 Assistant Engineers
2 Manager.

There are enough retirement-ready employees to mentor the next generation however, there were not enough current employees who qualified to be mentored. Pewlett Hackard will have to either extend the age range for mentor eligibility or hire outside of the company to fulfil the shoes left empty by the thousands of retirement-ready employees.
